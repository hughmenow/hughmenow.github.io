He sounded alarmed and told me that there was a security issue with the Java log4j code that we had used in one of our old projects. I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the gravity of the situation.</p><p>We had used log4j version 1.2.17 in one of our projects a few years back. At that time, it was one of the most popular and widely used logging frameworks for Java. However, it was later discovered that this version had a critical security vulnerability that could allow remote code execution. This vulnerability was dubbed as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228</a>.</p><p>My colleague explained that a new exploit was discovered that could leverage this vulnerability and allow attackers to take over the server. This was a nightmare scenario for any software developer or IT professional. We had to act fast to mitigate the risk and protect our clients’ data.</p><p>The first step was to check if any of our current projects were still using log4j version 1.2.17. We quickly realized that there were a few projects that were still using it, including the one we had developed a few years ago. We immediately started working on a plan to update the log4j version to the latest stable version.</p><p>However, we soon realized that it was easier said than done. Updating the log4j version required a lot of changes in the code, and we had to ensure that the new version was compatible with our existing codebase. We had to make sure that the changes did not break any existing functionality or introduce new bugs. It was a time-consuming and complex process that required a lot of careful planning and testing.</p><p>We spent the next few days working on the update, and it was a relief to see that it was successful. However, we also knew that there were many other old projects out there that were still vulnerable to the exploit. This was a problem that affected the entire industry, and it was not limited to just our projects.</p><p>We knew that we had to spread the word and warn others about the security issue. We wrote a blog post and shared it on social media to raise awareness about the issue. Furthermore, we also contacted our clients and advised them to update their systems as soon as possible.</p><p>The response was overwhelming. Many people thanked us for raising awareness about the issue, and some even asked for our help in updating their systems. It was heartening to see how the community came together to tackle this problem.</p><p>However, the story doesn’t end there. We soon realized that updating the log4j version was just the first step. There were other dependencies and libraries that also needed to be updated to ensure that our systems were fully secure. It was a never-ending battle to stay ahead of the threats and protect our systems.</p><p>In conclusion, the log4j vulnerability was a wake-up call for the entire software development community. It showed us the importance of keeping our systems up to date and being proactive in dealing with security threats. The incident also highlighted the need for better communication and collaboration between developers, IT professionals, and the wider community. It was a challenging time, but it also brought us together and reminded us of the importance of working together to overcome challenges.</p><div class="tagcloud"><span class="tagcloud-h">Tags:</span> <span class="tagcloud-tag tagcloud-tag-s"><a href="/tag/java/">java</a></span> <span class="tagcloud-tag tagcloud-tag-s"><a href="/tag/log4j/">log4j</a></span> <span class="tagcloud-tag tagcloud-tag-xl"><a href="/tag/posgresql/">posgresql</a></span></div></main><footer><div class="navigation"> <a class="next" href="/boosting-postgresql-performance">Boosting PostgreSQL Performance &raquo;</a></div><div class="bottom-footer"><div class="name">Hugh Garnier</div><div class="title">Linux user and software/system security researcher blog website</div></div></footer><!-- <script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({ extensions: ["tex2jax.js", "TeX/AMSmath.js"], jax: ["input/TeX", "output/SVG"], }) </script> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.6/MathJax.js?config=default"> </script> -->
